        <h1>Sisig</h1>
        <p>Sisig is a beloved Filipino dish that originated in Pampanga. Traditionally, it's made from chopped pork jowl, ears, and belly, 
            mixed with chicken liver, onions, and chili peppers, then served sizzling on a hot plate. Over time, variations have
             emerged, including chicken, seafood, and even tofu sisig.</p>
            <p>It's known for its rich, tangy, and savory flavors, often enhanced with calamansi juice and mayonnaise. Some say it pairs perfectly with a 
            cold drink, making it a favorite pulutan (beer snack) in gatherings. </p>
