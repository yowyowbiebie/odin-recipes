        <h1>Sinigang na Baboy</h1>
        <p>Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. 
            It's popular comfort food in the Philippines,  usually served on its own or paired with steamed rice on rainy days to ward off the cold.</p>
        <p>Like adobo, the term sinigang describes a cooking method more than a particular dish, as it has many variations. 
            It can be made with protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef, and chicken and 
            souring agents such as tamarind, guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol, and other native fruits.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
        <li>2 pounds pork spare ribs, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>6 pieces gabi, (peeled and halved depending on size)</li>
        <li>1 6-inch radish (labanos), peeled and sliced to ½-inch thick half-rounds</li>
        <li>2 finger chilies (siling haba)</li>
        <li>½ bunch long beans (sitaw), ends trimmed and cut into 3-inch lengths</li>
        <li>1 eggplant, ends trimmed and sliced to ½-inch thick half-rounds</li>
        <li>6 pieces okra, ends trimmed</li>
        <li>15 pieces large tamarind or 1 ½ (1.41 ounces each) packages tamarind base powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch bok choy or pechay, ends trimmed and separated into leaves</li>
 </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    
    <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
    <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
    <li>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 ½ hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.</li>
    <li>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
    <li>Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>

    <ol><h3>If Using Fresh Tamarind</h3>
        <li>Wash tamarind and place in a saucepan with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until soft and outer skins begin to burst.</li>
        <li>With a fork, mash tamarinds.</li>
        <li>In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, pour tamarind and liquid. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice.</li>
        <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot of sinigang.</li>
    </ol>
